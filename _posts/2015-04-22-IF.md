If I were a swan, I'd be gone.

If I were a train, I'd be late.

And if I were a good man,

I'd talk with you

More often than I do.

If I were to sleep, I could dream.

If I were afraid, I could hide.

If I go insane, please don't put

Your wires in my brain.

If I were the moon, I'd be cool.

If I were a rule, I would bend.

If I were a good man, I'd understand

The spaces between friends.

If I were alone, I would cry.

And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry.

And if I go insane,

Will you still let me join in with the game?

If I were a swan, I'd be gone.

If I were a train, I'd be late again.

If I were a good man,

I'd talk with you

More often than I do.
